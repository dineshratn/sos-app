# Implementation Plan: SOS App

## Task Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the SOS App development into atomic, agent-friendly tasks organized by infrastructure, backend services, and client applications. The approach follows a bottom-up strategy: infrastructure first, then core backend services, followed by client applications, and finally integration and testing.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Infrastructure, databases, core utilities
2. **Phase 2: Authentication & Users** - Auth service, user service, medical service
3. **Phase 3: Emergency Core** - Emergency service, location service, notification service
4. **Phase 4: Communication & Devices** - Communication service, device service
5. **Phase 5: Client Applications** - Mobile (iOS/Android) and Web applications
6. **Phase 6: Integration & Testing** - E2E flows, performance testing, deployment

## Steering Document Compliance

**Project Structure Conventions:**
- Monorepo with services/ and apps/ directories
- TypeScript for Node.js services with strict mode enabled
- Go services follow standard project layout
- Shared libraries in libs/ for cross-service code reuse
- Docker multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Kubernetes manifests with Helm charts for configurability

**Technical Standards:**
- All APIs follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Services communicate via gRPC for internal calls, REST for external
- Event-driven communication via Kafka with schema registry
- Database migrations with versioning (Flyway/golang-migrate)
- Unit tests with minimum 80% coverage per service
- Integration tests for inter-service communication
- Security-first: OAuth 2.0, JWT, encryption at rest/transit

## Atomic Task Requirements

**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**
- **File Scope**: Touches 1-3 related files maximum
- **Time Boxing**: Completable in 15-30 minutes
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Must specify exact files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Specify files**: Always include exact file paths to create/modify
- **Include implementation details** as bullet points
- Reference requirements using: `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_`
- Reference existing code to leverage using: `_Leverage: path/to/file.ts_`
- Focus only on coding tasks (no deployment, user testing, etc.)
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles
