# Requirements Document: SOS App

## Introduction

The SOS App is a comprehensive emergency response application designed to provide immediate assistance during critical situations. The application serves as a lifeline for users facing emergencies, enabling them to quickly request help, share their location, notify emergency contacts, and communicate with responders. The platform is built with a decoupled architecture supporting both web and mobile interfaces, with the capability to integrate with external IoT devices (wearables, panic buttons) and future AI/LLM capabilities for intelligent emergency assessment and response.

**Value Proposition:**
- **Rapid Response**: Reduce emergency response time through instant alert mechanisms
- **Universal Access**: Available across web and mobile platforms for ubiquitous access
- **Smart Integration**: Connect with external devices for automated emergency detection
- **Future-Ready**: Architecture designed to incorporate AI-powered emergency assessment and guidance
- **Reliable Communication**: Ensure critical information reaches the right people at the right time

## Alignment with Product Vision

This application represents a complete emergency response ecosystem that prioritizes:
- **User Safety**: Primary focus on getting help to users as quickly as possible
- **Accessibility**: Multi-platform support ensures help is available regardless of device
- **Scalability**: Decoupled architecture allows for independent scaling of web, mobile, and backend services
- **Extensibility**: Integration capabilities with IoT devices and LLM services for enhanced functionality
- **Reliability**: Critical system design for 99.9% uptime and fault tolerance
