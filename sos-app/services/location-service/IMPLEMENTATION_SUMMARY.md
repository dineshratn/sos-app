## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Kubernetes** - Use provided Dockerfile
2. **Set up monitoring** - Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards
3. **Configure alerts** - High latency, cache misses, Kafka failures
4. **Load testing** - Test with 10,000 concurrent updates
5. **Integration testing** - Test with Emergency Service
