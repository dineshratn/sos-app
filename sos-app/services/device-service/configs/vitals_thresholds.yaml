# Default vital sign thresholds for monitoring
default:
  heart_rate:
    min: 40      # Minimum heart rate in bpm
    max: 120     # Maximum heart rate in bpm

  spo2:
    min: 90      # Minimum oxygen saturation percentage

  temperature:
    min: 35.0    # Minimum body temperature in Celsius
    max: 38.5    # Maximum body temperature in Celsius

  blood_pressure:
    systolic:
      min: 90    # Minimum systolic BP in mmHg
      max: 180   # Maximum systolic BP in mmHg
    diastolic:
      min: 60    # Minimum diastolic BP in mmHg
      max: 120   # Maximum diastolic BP in mmHg

# Per-user customized thresholds
# These override the default thresholds for specific users
per_user:
  # Example: User with specific health conditions
  # "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000":
  #   heart_rate:
  #     min: 50
  #     max: 100
  #   spo2:
  #     min: 92
  #   temperature:
  #     min: 36.0
  #     max: 37.5
  #   blood_pressure:
  #     systolic:
  #       min: 100
  #       max: 160
  #     diastolic:
  #       min: 70
  #       max: 100

# Notes:
# - Heart rate thresholds are for resting heart rate
# - SpO2 below 90% is considered hypoxemia
# - Temperature ranges are for adults
# - Blood pressure thresholds are based on general health guidelines
# - Customize per_user thresholds based on individual health profiles
